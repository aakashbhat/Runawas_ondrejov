% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow "Thomas van Noord" and "Simon de Laguarde" and alike to be sorted by "N" and "L" etc. in the bibliography.
% Write the name in the bibliography as "\VAN{Noord}{Van}{van} Noord, Thomas"

\section{Introduction}


\section{Selection Procedure}

The selection of stars was done using the OB catalog of \citet{2003AJ....125.2531R}. We shortlisted sources with right ascension $\alpha$ between $17:00:00-04:00:00$ and declination $\delta>+20:00:00$, and a magnitude $>11$. This list was then cross-matched with Gaia DR3 and parallax values with a better uncertainty than 20\% and RUWE $<1.4$ were kept. The tangential velocities $V_{t}=4.75*\sigma/\pi$ and the Galactocentric coordinates x,y,z were computed for all the stars. The final list was created using the cut-off $V_{t}>30$ kms$^{-1}$ and $z>0.29$ kpc.



\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
Try to keep it short.



% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

\bibliographystyle{mnras}
\bibliography{example} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib


% Alternatively you could enter them by hand, like this:
% This method is tedious and prone to error if you have lots of references
%\begin{thebibliography}{99}
